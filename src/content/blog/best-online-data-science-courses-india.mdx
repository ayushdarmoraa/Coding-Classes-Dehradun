# Best Online Data Science Courses in India (Hands-on & Placement)

If you’re aiming for **data analyst**, **ML engineer**, or **data scientist** roles from India, focus on programs that are **project-heavy**, **mentor-led**, and **placement-oriented**. Below is a practical guide on *what to look for* and a shortlist to help you decide.

## What actually matters (beyond buzzwords)
- **Projects > slides.** End-to-end analytics/ML projects with datasets, EDA, modeling, and deployment.  
- **Mentors & reviews.** Live doubt-clearing, code reviews, and portfolio feedback.  
- **Placement help.** Resume, mock interviews, referrals—measurable support, not vague claims.  
- **Tools you’ll use at work.** Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, SQL, Git, cloud basics, dashboards (Tableau/Power BI).  
- **Time commitment.** 8–12 hrs/week across classes and projects is realistic for most learners.

## A simple evaluation checklist
Use this when comparing any program (print/save it):
- Curriculum covers **Python, SQL, EDA, ML**, plus a dashboard or deployment.
- **At least 3** portfolio-ready projects (capstone included).
- **Live** mentor time weekly + written code reviews.
- **Placement**: mock interviews, profile review, referrals or job board.
- Clear **schedule** and **start dates**; access to **recordings**.

## Shortlist: strong options for Indian learners
> Tip: Talk to an alum before enrolling. Look for shipped projects, not just certificates.

- **Doon Coding Academy – Online Data Science**  
  Live mentor sessions, **project-first** approach, recordings, and **placement support**. Good for beginners who want guided practice.

- **Self-paced MOOCs (for foundations)**  
  If you’re disciplined, pair recorded courses with a **project plan** and **peer code review**. Great for fundamentals; add mentorship later.

- **University/Exec programs (case-by-case)**  
  Useful if you want a brand name. Validate **project depth**, **mentor access**, and **outcomes** before committing.

## Sample 12-week roadmap (you can adapt)
- **Weeks 1–2:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, plotting; SQL basics  
- **Weeks 3–4:** EDA, feature engineering, scikit-learn workflow  
- **Weeks 5–6:** Classification/regression + metrics; dashboards (Power BI/Tableau)  
- **Weeks 7–8:** Capstone data pipeline (SQL → Pandas → model → viz)  
- **Weeks 9–10:** Model improvement, cross-validation, simple deployment choices  
- **Weeks 11–12:** Resume + portfolio polish, mock interviews

## Portfolio ideas employers like
- **A/B test deep-dive** with uplift analysis  
- **Sales/retail analytics** dashboard with clear insights  
- **Churn or credit-risk** model with business-friendly interpretation  
- **Time-series forecast** with error analysis and actions

## FAQs

**Can I break in without a master’s degree?**  
Yes—projects + internships beat credentials for most entry roles in India.

**Do I need heavy math?**  
Comfort with stats, probability, and linear algebra basics is enough to start. You’ll deepen as you build.

**How long does it take?**  
With 8–12 hrs/week, plan **12–16 weeks** to build portfolio-ready projects.
